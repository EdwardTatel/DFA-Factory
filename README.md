# DFA Factory
Thisapplication is basically a game that emulates the construction of DFA transition state
diagrams, as a pipe connecting puzzle game in a factory setting, where the user is
tasked to make non-traditional DFAs, using the provided objects of states and
transitions which resemble materials usually used in a pipe system.
